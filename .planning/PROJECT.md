# AI Engineer Learning Repository

## What This Is

A comprehensive, hands-on learning repository that takes intermediate developers through the complete AI Engineering curriculum via portfolio-quality projects, demos, and test-validated challenges. Combines Python fundamentals with modern AI techniques (LLMs, embeddings, RAG, agents, multimodal) to build job-ready senior-level expertise.

## Core Value

By completing this repository, learners have both the knowledge and demonstrable portfolio to apply for senior AI Engineering roles.

- [ ] **Project 3**: Multimodal application (vision, audio, speech integration)
- [ ] **Project 4**: Fine-tuning & optimization (custom models, performance tuning, deployment)
- [ ] **Project 5**: End-to-end production system (combines multiple techniques, real-world scale)

### Out of Scope

- Infrastructure/deployment deep-dives — learner already has DevOps/K8s experience
- Frontend UI implementation — focus is on AI/ML concepts, not web development
- Data science/ML fundamentals — assumes intermediate programming background
- Academic ML theory — practical engineering focus

## Context

**Learner Background:**
- Full-stack web development (Java, JavaScript)
- DevOps engineer with cloud deployment experience (Kubernetes)
- University CS student (Information Systems bachelor's)
- Strong systems thinking and API design experience

**Learning Approach:**
- Hands-on coding exercises (demos, notebooks, challenges)
- Automated test verification for progress tracking
- Topic-based folder structure matching curriculum
- Real API usage (learners bring own keys)
- Local development environment (Docker containers)

**Curriculum Source:**
Based on comprehensive AI Engineer roadmap covering:
- Python fundamentals → Pre-trained models → OpenAI API → Open source → Safety → Embeddings → RAG → Agents → Multimodal → Tools

**Success Metric:**
Repository completion = job-ready for senior AI Engineering roles with portfolio demonstrating:
- Architecture decisions (RAG vs fine-tuning, model selection)
- Production thinking (scaling, costs, monitoring, security)
- Complex system design (multi-agent, multimodal, end-to-end)
- Real-world problem solving (not toy tutorials)

## Constraints

- **Timeline**: 3-6 months for completion
- **Budget**: Self-funded API costs (OpenAI, etc.) - not a limiting factor
- **Hardware**: Local development with adequate GPU for fine-tuning exercises
- **Hosting**: Local via Docker containers where needed
- **Visibility**: Private repository (at least initially)
- **Focus**: AI/ML concepts over infrastructure/deployment (leveraging existing expertise)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| 3-5 major portfolio projects vs many small exercises | Senior-level depth requires real projects; portfolio value for job applications | — Pending |
| Hybrid Python teaching (foundations + just-in-time) | Need solid base but reinforce through AI context | — Pending |
| Automated test verification | Ensures actual learning vs passive consumption; tracks progress objectively | — Pending |
| Topic-based folder structure | Matches mental model of curriculum; easy navigation | — Pending |
| Real APIs (no mocks) | Authentic experience with actual tools used in production | — Pending |
| Local-first development | Reduces costs; learner has hardware; Docker provides consistency | — Pending |
