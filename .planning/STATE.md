**Core value:** By completing this repository, learners have both the knowledge and demonstrable portfolio to apply for senior AI Engineering roles.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Environment Setup & Infrastructure

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 10 (Environment Setup & Infrastructure)
Plan: 0 of 11 in current phase
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-02-10 — Phase 1 detailed plans created (11 plans, ~10 hours estimated)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0% (Phase 1: 0/11 plans complete)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Research identified critical pitfalls: API deprecation (needs version pinning), cost explosions (needs estimates), environment setup hell (needs multiple paths)
- Comprehensive depth setting yielded 10 phases following proven education patterns: Foundation → Core AI → Advanced → Production
- Phase structure follows natural requirement groupings with dependencies: Python before LLMs before RAG before Agents

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 1 considerations:**
- All 11 plans defined with clear deliverables and verification criteria
- Critical path: 01-01 → 01-02 → 01-04 → 01-11 (~10 hours total estimated)
- Environment setup must support multiple paths (Docker, local) to prevent abandonment
- Version pinning strategy critical from day 1 to prevent API breakage
- Cost tracking utilities needed before creating expensive exercises
- Next: Begin execution with Plan 01-01 (Create Base Repository Structure)

**Future phase considerations:**
- Phase 7 (Agents): Agent frameworks evolving rapidly, may need research during planning for current best practices
- Phase 8 (Multimodal): API capabilities changing, may need verification of latest features
- Phase 10 (Portfolio Projects): Should be reviewed by industry professionals during planning
