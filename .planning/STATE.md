# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-10)

**Core value:** By completing this repository, learners have both the knowledge and demonstrable portfolio to apply for senior AI Engineering roles.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 - Python Fundamentals for AI

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 10 (Python Fundamentals for AI)
Plan: 0 of 8 in current phase
Status: Plans defined, ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-02-10 — Phase 2 detailed plans created (8 plans, ~18-26 hours estimated)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0% (Phase 2: 0/8 plans complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 11
- Phase 1 duration: ~4 hours (estimated 10 hours)
- Total execution time: 4 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| Phase 1 | 11 | 4h | ~22 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-07 through 01-11 completed
- Trend: Efficient execution, under original estimate

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1 complete: Solid foundation enables efficient Phase 2 execution
- Phase 2 structure: 8 plans covering 7 requirements + integration testing
- Learning approach: Hands-on notebooks + exercises + tests for each topic
- Module organization: Each Python concept gets dedicated plan with 2-4 hour scope
- Integration plan: Final plan (02-08) ensures all patterns work together

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 2 planning:**
- All 8 plans defined with clear deliverables (02-01 through 02-08)
- Estimated effort: 18-26 hours total
- Critical path: async → types → errors → API → OOP → integration
- Dependencies: Phase 1 infrastructure (Docker, utils, validation) ready
- Content creation: 20+ notebooks, 15+ exercises to create
- Testing strategy: pytest suite with >80% coverage target
- Next: Begin execution with Plan 02-01 (Async Programming Module)

**Future considerations:**
- Phase 3 will build on Phase 2 Python patterns
- Cost tracking from Phase 1 will be used throughout Phase 2 exercises
- Async patterns in Phase 2 critical for efficient API usage in Phase 3+

**Future phase considerations:**
- Phase 7 (Agents): Agent frameworks evolving rapidly, may need research during planning for current best practices
- Phase 8 (Multimodal): API capabilities changing, may need verification of latest features
- Phase 10 (Portfolio Projects): Should be reviewed by industry professionals during planning
