# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-10)

**Core value:** By completing this repository, learners have both the knowledge and demonstrable portfolio to apply for senior AI Engineering roles.
**Current focus:** Phase 3 - AI Fundamentals & OpenAI API

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 10 (Python Fundamentals for AI) - ✅ **COMPLETE**
Plan: 8 of 8 in current phase
Status: Phase 2 verified and complete
Last activity: 2026-02-10 — Phase 2 all plans complete, success criteria verified

Progress: [██████████] 100% (Phase 2: 8/8 plans complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 19 (11 Phase 1 + 8 Phase 2)
- Phase 1 duration: ~4 hours
- Phase 2 duration: ~3 hours  
- Total execution time: 7 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| Phase 1 | 11 | 4h | ~22 min |
| Phase 2 | 8 | 3h | ~22 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 02-04 through 02-08 completed
- Trend: Consistent ~22 min per plan, highly efficient

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1 complete: Solid foundation enables efficient Phase 2 execution
- Phase 2 structure: 8 plans covering 7 requirements + integration testing
- Learning approach: Hands-on notebooks + exercises + tests for each topic
- Module organization: Each Python concept gets dedicated plan with 2-4 hour scope
- Integration plan: Final plan (02-08) ensures all patterns work together

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 2: ✅ COMPLETE**
- All 8 plans delivered and verified
- All 5 success criteria met:
  1. ✓ Async code with concurrent API calls
  2. ✓ Type hints and Pydantic validation
  3. ✓ Production logging and error handling
  4. ✓ REST APIs and file I/O
  5. ✓ OOP patterns (classes, decorators, context managers)
- All 7 requirements (PY-01 through PY-07) complete
- Ready to proceed to Phase 3

**Next Phase: Phase 3 (AI Fundamentals & OpenAI API)**
- Define detailed plans for 13 requirements (AI-01 to AI-07, OAI-01 to OAI-06)
- Build on Phase 2 Python patterns
- First real AI content with LLMs
- Estimated: 12-15 hours of content

**Future phase considerations:**
- Phase 7 (Agents): Agent frameworks evolving rapidly, may need research during planning for current best practices
- Phase 8 (Multimodal): API capabilities changing, may need verification of latest features
- Phase 10 (Portfolio Projects): Should be reviewed by industry professionals during planning

## Session Continuity
