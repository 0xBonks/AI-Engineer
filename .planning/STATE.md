## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Research identified critical pitfalls: API deprecation (needs version pinning), cost explosions (needs estimates), environment setup hell (needs multiple paths)
- Comprehensive depth setting yielded 10 phases following proven education patterns: Foundation → Core AI → Advanced → Production
- Phase structure follows natural requirement groupings with dependencies: Python before LLMs before RAG before Agents

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 1 considerations:**
- Environment setup must support multiple paths (Docker, local, potentially Colab) to prevent 30%+ abandonment
- Version pinning strategy critical from day 1 to prevent API breakage
- Cost tracking utilities needed before creating expensive exercises

**Future phase considerations:**
- Phase 7 (Agents): Agent frameworks evolving rapidly, may need research during planning for current best practices
- Phase 8 (Multimodal): API capabilities changing, may need verification of latest features
- Phase 10 (Portfolio Projects): Should be reviewed by industry professionals during planning
