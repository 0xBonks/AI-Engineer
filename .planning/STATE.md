# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-10)

**Core value:** By completing this repository, learners have both the knowledge and demonstrable portfolio to apply for senior AI Engineering roles.
**Current focus:** Phase 3 - AI Fundamentals & OpenAI API

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 10 (AI Fundamentals & OpenAI API)
Plan: 0 of 8 in current phase
Status: Plans defined, ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-02-10 — Phase 3 detailed plans created (8 plans, ~18-25 hours estimated)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0% (Phase 3: 0/8 plans complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 19 (11 Phase 1 + 8 Phase 2)
- Phase 1 duration: ~4 hours
- Phase 2 duration: ~3 hours  
- Total execution time: 7 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| Phase 1 | 11 | 4h | ~22 min |
| Phase 2 | 8 | 3h | ~22 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 02-04 through 02-08 completed
- Trend: Consistent ~22 min per plan, highly efficient

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1 complete: Solid foundation enables efficient Phase 2 execution
- Phase 2 structure: 8 plans covering 7 requirements + integration testing
- Learning approach: Hands-on notebooks + exercises + tests for each topic
- Module organization: Each Python concept gets dedicated plan with 2-4 hour scope
- Integration plan: Final plan (02-08) ensures all patterns work together

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 3 planning:**
- All 8 plans defined with clear deliverables (03-01 through 03-08)
- Estimated effort: 18-25 hours total
- Critical path: fundamentals → Chat API → prompt engineering → costs → integration
- First real AI content: LLMs, OpenAI API, prompt engineering
- Builds on Phase 2: async, types, error handling patterns all apply
- Mini-project: AI Writing Assistant (combines all concepts)
- Next: Begin execution with Plan 03-01 (AI Fundamentals)

**Considerations:**
- Phase 3 requires OpenAI API key for exercises
- Cost tracking from Phase 1 will monitor spending
- Async patterns from Phase 2 enable efficient batch processing
- Type safety from Phase 2 ensures reliable API interaction

**Future phase considerations:**
- Phase 7 (Agents): Agent frameworks evolving rapidly, may need research during planning for current best practices
- Phase 8 (Multimodal): API capabilities changing, may need verification of latest features
- Phase 10 (Portfolio Projects): Should be reviewed by industry professionals during planning
