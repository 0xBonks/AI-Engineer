# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-10)

**Core value:** By completing this repository, learners have both the knowledge and demonstrable portfolio to apply for senior AI Engineering roles.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Environment Setup & Infrastructure

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 10 (Environment Setup & Infrastructure) - ✅ **COMPLETE**
Plan: 11 of 11 in current phase
Status: Phase 1 verified and complete
Last activity: 2026-02-10 — Phase 1 integration testing complete, all success criteria verified

Progress: [██████████] 100% (Phase 1: 11/11 plans complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 11
- Phase 1 duration: ~4 hours (estimated 10 hours)
- Total execution time: 4 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| Phase 1 | 11 | 4h | ~22 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-07 through 01-11 completed
- Trend: Efficient execution, under original estimate

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Research identified critical pitfalls: API deprecation (needs version pinning), cost explosions (needs estimates), environment setup hell (needs multiple paths)
- Comprehensive depth setting yielded 10 phases following proven education patterns: Foundation → Core AI → Advanced → Production
- Phase structure follows natural requirement groupings with dependencies: Python before LLMs before RAG before Agents

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 1: ✅ COMPLETE**
- All 11 plans delivered and verified
- All 5 success criteria met:
  1. ✓ Environment validation script functional
  2. ✓ Docker environment with one-command startup
  3. ✓ Complete repository structure with module READMEs
  4. ✓ .env.example with all API keys
  5. ✓ CI/CD pipeline configured
- Ready to proceed to Phase 2

**Next Phase: Phase 2 (Python Fundamentals for AI)**
- Define detailed plans for 7 requirements (PY-01 through PY-07)
- Estimated modules: async, types, error handling, API patterns, data handling, OOP
- Create exercises, notebooks, and tests
- Build on Phase 1 infrastructure

**Future phase considerations:**
- Phase 7 (Agents): Agent frameworks evolving rapidly, may need research during planning for current best practices
- Phase 8 (Multimodal): API capabilities changing, may need verification of latest features
- Phase 10 (Portfolio Projects): Should be reviewed by industry professionals during planning
